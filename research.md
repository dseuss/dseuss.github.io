## research interests
My research interests lies somewhere in the intersection of quantum physics and what has been coined “data science” in recent years.
Some questions I am trying to answer currently include

- Can we adapt techniques from compressed sensing to the problem of characterising linear optical circuits? [More...]({% post_url 2016-05-11-phaselift %})
- What constitutes a “good” error region for quantum state estimation? Are there computational limits on how we can incorporate prior information to improve an error region?
- How can we circumvent the “curse of dimensionality” in quantum state estimation by exploiting prior information on the physical system? [More...]({% post_url 2016-03-01-mpnum %})


Furthermore, I am a strong proponent of open science.
This is why you can find most of my work on [github](https://github.com/dseuss).
There, you can also find [slides and posters](https://github.com/dseuss/presentations) of previous presentations.
